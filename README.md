![Empedocles](./docs/empedocles.png "Empedocles")

A fast and simple static documentation generator based on Markdown written in Go.

This tool generates static documentation based on Markdown sources in a fast, efficient, and lightweight manner.\
It requires no external dependencies and is designed to be both easy to use and quick to set up.

## When to use

You might need this tool if this is relevant:

- you prefer to [get your HTML docs](./docs/gettingstarted.md) rapidly ðŸ”¥
- you like a small runtime images (3Mb executable)
- zero dependencies is a plus for you (no runtime dependencies or any third-party libs, everything is already bundled in the executable)
- you don't need fancy features like interactive search, animations etc.
- you need a documentation with no JavaScript
- your documentation is a single README.md file in the project dir and multiple MD/static files in `./docs` or other dir.

## When not to use

You might might want to consider other static documentation generators, if:

- you need more features: search, macros processing, advanced templates/theming, partial customizations.
- you want more interactive docs, containing javascript, animations, etc.
